   - After installation, you can launch the application from the Start Menu, using the shortcut created on your desktop, or by pressing __ctrl + shift + s__.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project largely came from my frustration while collecting data for Physics research. I had to manually input a lot of data from images and was unable to find easy-to-use OCR applications. 
Issues: 
- A lot of available OCR products only work on the internet by scraping web links.
- While the applications that work on a system-wide level are either slow/cumbersome or very inaccurate.

So, I set out to resolve this by making a system-wide snipping tool that directly grabs screen data from the Operating System and processes that through Google's Tesseract Engine. It's also very quick and easy to use and the entire process can be completed in a single shortcut input and snip bound selection.
